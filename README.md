# syntherm

syntherm is a simple digital synthesizer working right in your terminal 

(idfk hit me up for better name ideas)

currently has sin, saw, and triangle oscilators, adsr envelope, velocity sensitivity, and 8 voice polyphony (though really however many you want)

the polyphony sounds horribly overdriven though, if you have any theories on why, let me know

tui coming soon, i need to fucking make cmake link notcurses first
